Leonard and Sheldon are brilliant physicists, but none of that genius helps them interact with people, especially women. All this begins to change when a free-spirited beauty, Penny, moves in next door. Sheldon is content spending his nights playing Klingon Boggle with their socially dysfunctional friends. However, Leonard sees in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities ... including love.">

Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows a team of detectives headed by the overly serious, newly appointed Captain Raymond Holt. The detectives include Jake Peralta, who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his nerdy, by-the-book but lovable partner, Amy Santiago.">
